# Explanation

With my wifi 6 router update, I have issues with squeezebox radios not able to connect anymore to wifi.

Even connecting to the legacy router is an issue.

I have posted messages to squeezebox forums : https://forums.slimdevices.com/showthread.php?97791-Squeezebox-Radio-keeps-losing-wireless-connection-and-won-t-reconnect-any-ideas/page10

POMdev, an active user, has developped a logging approach to keep track of connectivity issues. My intent is to plot results of these log files.

I have 2 radios, one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom.
